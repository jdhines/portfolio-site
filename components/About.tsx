      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Currently working as a Principal Software Engineer and tech lead at
        Fidelity Investments, I&rsquo;m responsible for building applications to
        support our associates in being more efficient and productive during
        complex and challenging client implementations.

      <p>
        I love crafting experiences that are valuable, meaningful, and
        enjoyable. I have a passion for continuous improvement through
        refactoring, redesign, and automation. Having extensive practice in
        design, development, agile leadership, and strong communication and
        presentation skills, I&rsquo;m dedicated to improving every project I
        take part in. Learning is a lifelong endeavor for me, and as a tech
        lead, my goal is to encourage growth and build up teams into
        cooperative, efficient, and effective groups that consistently deliver
        results and exceed expectations. I&rsquo;m always looking for new
        challenges, and am always eager to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love mountain biking, woodworking, and playing games
        with my family.
