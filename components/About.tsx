      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently working as a Principal Software Engineer and tech lead at
        Fidelity Investments responsible for building applications to support
        our associates in being more efficient and productive during complex and
        challenging client implementations. In this role I oversee a team of
        several developers, planning out the work, and building a team dedicated
        to discovering problems and solving for user needs.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        I'm always looking for new challenges, and am always eager to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love mountain biking, woodworking, and playing games
        with my family.
