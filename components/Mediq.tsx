    <p><b>My role:</b> UX & UI Design, Front-end development (Angular)</p>
    <p><b>Project brief:</b> MEDIQ started life as a Microsoft Access application, and was in use for approximately 10 years. There were actually dozens of copies, one for each new client. It could be quite slow depending on the amount of data, and it hadnâ€™t been updated in years. The ask was to replace them with one web app utilizing a proper database, that could provide fixes and additional features as necessary. The team featured myself in the aboved named role, one database/ETL person, and one person to write the Spring API.</p>
